# JavaMe
JavaMe is a project I've created that highlights my understanding of what I believe to be fundamental and essential Java concepts. Please note that this does not highlight programming concepts for the absolute beginner. 

You can view each major concept/topic as folders inside the 'javaessentials' package. 
    TODO: add more packages to showcase understanding of advanced Java concepts and software testing.
